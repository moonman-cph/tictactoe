# Product Roadmap

This roadmap exists to guide architectural decisions during active development. Before implementing any feature, check whether it conflicts with a future milestone. Prefer choices that leave future doors open over choices that are simpler today but expensive to undo.

The team is small for the foreseeable future — parallel development is not a current priority, but module boundaries should be kept clean so that work can be split across teams or agents later without major refactoring.

---

## M1 — Foundation ✓ Complete
Single user, single dummy organisation, flat JSON file persistence, single-file HTML apps. Suitable for UX iteration and feature development. No auth, no multi-tenancy.

**Constraints that apply now:**
- Every data entity must already carry an `orgId` field (even if it always equals `"default"` in M1), so the migration to a multi-tenant database requires no schema restructuring.
- Do not store sensitive data (salaries, personal details) in `localStorage`, unprotected cookies, or client-side JS bundles. The habit must start now.
- Do not embed business logic or access rules in HTML files beyond rendering. Logic that will eventually need to be enforced server-side should be clearly separated.

**Changelog (introduced in M1):** A server-side diff engine intercepts every `POST /api/data` call, compares the previous and new state, and appends field-level change entries to `changelog.json`. Entries capture entity type, entity ID, field, old value, new value, timestamp, IP address, user agent, an optional change reason, and a correlation ID grouping all changes from one save. Actor identity is `null` in M1 (no auth); it is populated in M3.

**M1 Limitation:** Changelog logging is API-level only. Any direct edit to `orgchart-data.json` on disk bypasses it entirely. The data write and changelog write are two separate `fs.writeFileSync` calls — a crash between them leaves data without a log entry. A future code path that writes the file without going through `POST /api/data` would also be invisible to the log. This is acceptable for M1 (single-user, dev mode). The hard guarantee is delivered in M2 via PostgreSQL triggers (see M2 below).

---

## M2 — Database, API Layer & Multi-Tenancy Foundations ✓ Complete
Replace the JSON file with **PostgreSQL on Azure**. The app is deployed on **Azure App Service** with a managed **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** instance (`teampura-demo.postgres.database.azure.com`). PostgreSQL is chosen because it natively supports schema-per-tenant isolation, row-level security (RLS), field-level encryption via extensions (`pgcrypto`), JSON columns for flexible config, and scales from single-server to fully managed cloud deployments.

Introduce a versioned REST API: all routes move to `/api/v1/`. No route may be removed or changed in a breaking way once published — add new versions instead.

**M2 Progress:**
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PostgreSQL connectivity | ✓ Done | Live on Azure (`db/index.js`) |
| `/api/v1/` versioned routes | ✓ Done | M1 aliases still work for backward compat |
| Async database layer | ✓ Done | File fallback for local dev |
| Migration script | ✓ Done | `db/migrate.js` — idempotent JSON → DB import |
| `audit_log` table | ✓ Done | Append-only, application-driven |
| Changelog filtering API | ✓ Done | Full query/filter support |
| Sensitive field detection | ✓ Done | `isSensitive` flag set in audit entries |
| Normalized schema | ✓ Done | 9-table design deployed; `org_state` blob removed (migration runs on first DB call) |
| Column-level encryption | ✓ Done | AES-256-GCM in `lib/encrypt.js`; migration v3 re-encrypts existing data on first boot |
| Input validation | ✓ Done | `POST /api/data` validates shape, required fields, and types; AI route validates prompt and history |

Security foundations introduced in this milestone:
- TLS enforced everywhere — handled by Azure App Service.
- Sensitive fields (salary, personal identifiers) encrypted at field level via `pgcrypto`; encryption keys managed via Azure Key Vault.
- The changelog introduced in M1 migrates from `changelog.json` to a PostgreSQL `audit_log` table (done). The table is append-only (INSERT + SELECT only). The diff and data write should occur in a single transaction.
- Input sanitisation and server-side validation on all API endpoints. No trust of client-supplied data.

**Architecture pattern — modular monolith:** The application is one deployable unit, but internally divided into strict modules (auth, org-data, compensation, workflows, AI, export). No module may import another module's internals — only its public interface. This allows a module to be extracted into a standalone microservice later by moving the module and updating the router, without rewriting business logic. The compensation module is the most likely candidate for early extraction due to its distinct security and access requirements.

---

## M3 — Authentication & Role-Based Access Control ✓ Complete
Login, sessions, and JWT-based auth. Role-based access is enforced **server-side on every API response** — not just hidden in the UI.

Five roles:
- `super_admin` — platform operator; can manage all customer orgs.
- `org_admin` — customer administrator; manages their org's users, settings, and data.
- `hr` — full read/write access to all HR data within their org.
- `manager` — read access to their reporting line; can initiate HR processes for their reports.
- `employee` — read access to their own record; can update designated personal fields.

Sensitive fields (salary, band, personal data) are **opt-in from the API** — never returned in a response unless the requesting user's role explicitly permits it. Hiding data via CSS or JS is never acceptable as a security measure.

**M3 Progress:**
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| JWT auth (login / logout / me) | ✓ Done | httpOnly cookie, 8h expiry, `lib/auth.js` |
| `users` DB table | ✓ Done | email + bcrypt hash + role + person_id link |
| Super-admin seed on first boot | ✓ Done | `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars |
| All routes protected | ✓ Done | `requireAuth` middleware on every API route |
| Role-scoped GET /api/v1/data | ✓ Done | `lib/data-scope.js` — salary/DOB filtered by rights; dateOfBirth gated on `view_directory` not `view_salaries` |
| Write gated on effective rights | ✓ Done | `POST /api/v1/data` checks effective rights via `getEffectiveRights`; allows personId-impersonated users with write rights |
| Actor fields in audit log | ✓ Done | userId, email, role from JWT on every write |
| Login page wired up | ✓ Done | `index.html` — real POST /api/v1/auth/login; version number shown in footer |
| All pages redirect to login | ✓ Done | `shared-auth.js` — fetch interceptor + initial check |
| Nav shows logged-in user + logout | ✓ Done | `shared-nav.js` listens for auth:ready event |
| `/api/v1/health` status endpoint | ✓ Done | Public — checks DB, encryption key, JWT secret |
| `changeReason` mandatory for sensitive writes | ✗ Deferred to M5 | Tied to EU Pay Transparency compliance trail; enforced when M5 ships |
| Role-based nav visibility + org chart constraints | ✓ Done | `lib/permissions.js` + `shared-nav.js` + `orgchart.html`; rights returned from `/api/v1/auth/me` |
| Permission groups with allow/deny model | ✓ Done | Assignment policies match any role (not just primary); deny always wins over allow |
| personId impersonation (switch-user) | ✓ Done | Super-admin can preview as any org person; rights derived from permission system, not JWT role |
| Rights enforcement in `dashboard.html` | ✓ Done | Salary cards gated on `view_salaries`; age distribution on `view_directory`; awaits auth before render |
| Rights enforcement in `directory.html` | ✓ Done | Salary column + edit controls gated on `view_salaries` / `edit_directory`; waits for auth:ready |
| Rights enforcement in `paybands.html` | ✓ Done | Full page blocked for `!view_pay_bands`; read-only view for `!edit_pay_bands` |
| Rights enforcement in `orgchart.html` modal | ✓ Done | Salary band section hidden without `view_salaries`; role edit button hidden without `edit_org_chart`; re-enforced after init() overwrites server settings |
| AI assistant identity from session | ✓ Done | Person selector removed; identity derived from active JWT; apply gated on write rights |
| AI context includes manager names | ✓ Done | `routes/v1/ai.js` builds `roleOccupant` map so "who is my manager?" resolves correctly |
| AI action cards gated on write rights | ✓ Done | Apply button hidden for roles without write access; server enforces independently |
| Modal UX — Close vs Save/Cancel | ✓ Done | Save only shown when actively editing a role; person-tab flags auto-save on click |
| Employee self-service field edits | ✗ Deferred to M7 | Out of scope for M3 |

## M4 — Platform Operator Console & Org-Admin Self-Service ⚠ Partially Complete
The operator console is a protected `/admin` section of the app, accessible only to `super_admin` role. It is the internal tool for managing all customer organisations. Org-admin self-service (inviting users, managing their own org) ships in the same milestone.

**M4 Progress:**
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `organisations` DB table | ✓ Done | Authoritative org registry with plan_tier, status, trial_expires_at |
| Org-admin invite / user management | ✗ Not started | No `/admin` page exists yet |
| Operator console UI | ✗ Not started | Deferred — internal tooling, not customer-facing |
| Licence tier enforcement (headcount caps, feature flags) | ✗ Not started | `org_config` table exists; enforcement logic not implemented |
| Trial expiry / suspension | ✗ Not started | — |

**Decision — deprioritise M4 console:** The operator console is internal tooling and not customer-facing. Given the EU Pay Transparency deadline of **June 7, 2026 (≈8 weeks away)**, M5 is the higher-priority milestone. M4 console work can proceed in parallel or follow M5 without blocking anything customer-facing.

**Operator console — Organisation Management:**
- Org list: name, plan tier, headcount, last activity, status (Trial / Active / Suspended)
- Create org: name, slug (orgId), plan tier, org_admin email (sends invite)
- Org detail: headcount, active users, last data write, trial expiry
- Edit org: rename, change tier, adjust trial expiry date
- Suspend / reactivate: blocks all logins for that org without touching data
- Offboard: export org data as JSON, then permanently delete all rows for that `orgId`

**Operator console — User Management (cross-org):**
- Search users by email across all orgs
- View a user: org, role, login history, last seen, account status
- Reset password / force logout (invalidates all active sessions)
- Lock / unlock account
- Impersonation: "Login as this user" — creates a time-limited JWT (30 min) with claims `{ impersonating: true, originalActor: operatorId }`. Every action is written to `audit_log` with `source: 'impersonation'` so the trail is always attributable.

**Operator console — Monitoring:**
- Health status light: `/api/v1/health` checks DB connectivity, encryption key presence, and last successful write. Returns `{ status: 'green' | 'amber' | 'red', checks: [...] }`. Public endpoint — no auth required — usable as an uptime monitor. Built in M3 as a foundation piece.
- Per-org activity: last login, last data write, headcount, active session count
- Trial expiry alerts: orgs expiring within 14 days
- Cross-org audit log viewer: same UI as changelog.html, filterable by org, user, entity type, date range

**Operator console — Customer Support Tools:**
- Audit log viewer filtered to a specific org (read-only)
- Permission inspector: enter a user ID, see their effective role and data scope without logging in as them
- Data export: download all data for an org as JSON (GDPR data portability)
- Feature flags: enable/disable per-org features (AI, pay transparency, public API, CSV export) — stored in existing `org_config` table

**Licence tiers** — gate both headcount and features:

| Tier | Headcount | AI | Pay Transparency | Public API | Support |
|------|-----------|----|-----------------|------------|---------|
| Trial | ≤ 25 | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | Email |
| Starter | ≤ 100 | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | Email |
| Pro | ≤ 500 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Priority |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Dedicated |

Trial orgs auto-suspend on expiry (30 days). Warning emails sent at T-7 and T-1. Headcount limit blocks new person creation when at or over the tier cap.

**Org-admin self-service** (regular app pages, not /admin):
- Invite users by email, assign roles (hr / manager / employee)
- Remove users / revoke access
- Edit org settings (name, currency, feature preferences)

**New DB tables introduced in M4:**
- `organisations` — `{ id (orgId), name, plan_tier, status, trial_expires_at, created_at }` — authoritative registry of valid org IDs; all existing tables already carry `org_id`
- `users` table introduced in M3 (auth) is referenced here for user management

---

## M4.5 — Background Jobs, Scheduled Execution & Daily Metrics ✓ Complete
Server-side infrastructure for running tasks reliably without a browser — the foundation for all future workflow automation.

**Problem solved:** The existing "Planned Change" (org freeze) feature relied on a browser-side `setInterval` timer. If no user was on the page at the scheduled time, the change never fired. Snapshots and planned change state were also not being persisted to PostgreSQL.

**What shipped in M4.5:**
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `scheduled_jobs` table | ✓ Done | Stores pending/running/completed/failed/cancelled jobs with type, payload, schedule |
| `daily_metrics` table | ✓ Done | One row per org per day — comprehensive JSONB metrics blob for future trend reports |
| `lib/scheduler.js` | ✓ Done | Polls every 60s; executes due jobs; captures daily metrics if not yet done today |
| `routes/v1/jobs.js` | ✓ Done | `POST/GET/DELETE /api/v1/jobs` — UI registers and cancels jobs |
| Planned change server-side execution | ✓ Done | `PLANNED_CHANGE` job type: applies org state, auto-snapshots pre-change state, writes full audit log with `source: scheduled_job` |
| `plannedChange` + `snapshots` DB persistence | ✓ Done | Both now saved to `org_config` via `configKeys`; previously lost on server restart |
| `orgchart.html` integration | ✓ Done | Freeze registers job → gets jobId; cancel/apply/unfreezeToEdit cancel the server-side job |

**Architectural rules this milestone establishes:**
- All scheduled actions are stored in `scheduled_jobs` before execution — no fire-and-forget timers in application code.
- The scheduler is the sole executor of scheduled jobs. The browser-side timer is a best-effort UX convenience only; it cancels the server-side job on apply to prevent double-execution.
- Every automated data change is attributed with `source: 'scheduled_job'` in the audit log. Actor fields are `null` / `'system'` for machine-initiated changes.
- `daily_metrics` captures all org metrics (headcount, salary totals, vacancies, gender split, level distribution, contract types) as a JSONB blob daily — schema-free so future reports can query any dimension without a migration.

**Future job types (M7+):**
- `NOTIFICATION` — send in-app or email notifications to users
- `PROCESS_TRIGGER` — start an HR workflow (onboarding, performance review cycle, etc.)
- `REPORT_GENERATE` — generate and cache a scheduled report
- Event-based triggers (headcount threshold, salary band breach) will be added in M7

**Workflows UI** — A `/jobs.html` page where admins can create, view, and cancel scheduled workflows is planned for M7. For now, jobs are created programmatically by the UI (e.g., the Freeze modal).

---

## M4.6 — Reports & Analytics ✓ Complete
Analytics dashboard and full reports page with pre-built templates, trend reports, custom builder, and insight callouts.

**What shipped:**
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `reports.html` — 24 pre-built templates | ✓ Done | Headcount, compensation, diversity, org structure |
| Trend reports (changelog replay) | ✓ Done | Headcount trend, new joiners, payroll budget |
| Custom report builder | ✓ Done | 4-step wizard: entity → field → aggregation → dimension |
| Saved reports (localStorage) | ✓ Done | Up to 50 reports per user |
| 5 new reports (v0.11.0) | ✓ Done | Attrition rate, pay spread by level, promotion rate, gender pipeline, org layering trend |
| Insight callouts | ✓ Done | Amber callout surfaces key finding automatically on any report |
| % breakdowns in count reports | ✓ Done | All headcount/distribution reports show count + percentage |
| Demo history seeder | ✓ Done | Seeds 18mo synthetic data: hires, salary changes, promotions, attrition |
| Empty states for trend reports | ✓ Done | Guides users to seed demo history when no changelog data exists |
| `dashboard.html` | ✓ Done | Separate analytics page with KPI cards, charts, salary totals |

**Remaining analytics gaps (feed into M5):**
- `changeReason` audit trail not yet surfaced in pay equity reports
- Salary band compliance report exists but band configuration UX is minimal (paybands.html)
- No scheduled / cached reports (planned for M7)

---

## M5 — Salary Bands & EU Pay Transparency ⚡ URGENT — deadline June 7, 2026
Full salary band management: define bands per role/level, flag employees outside their band, document rationale for individual salary decisions. Pay gap reporting across gender, department, and level.

**Deadline context:** EU Pay Transparency regulation requires organisations to demonstrate and document equal pay by **June 7, 2026 — approximately 8 weeks away**. This milestone is the highest priority.

The `changeReason` field captured on every salary write (introduced in M1) is the primary compliance trail. Pay gap reporting draws on `audit_log` to show the history of salary band assignments and documented justifications.

**Groundwork already in place from M4.6:**
- `pay-gender-gap` report with gap % per level and widest-gap insight callout
- `pay-level-spread` report showing P25–P75 range and coefficient of variation per level
- `pay-band-health` report showing in/above/below band counts
- `pay-review-flags` report with % flagged per department
- `paybands.html` — band configuration page (read/write, per level min/max/midpoint)
- `isSensitive` flag + `changeReason` field already captured in audit log for every salary write

**Remaining M5 work:**
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `changeReason` mandatory on salary writes | ✗ Not done | Server rejects if absent or < 10 chars; deferred from M3 |
| Pay equity report with `changeReason` trail | ✗ Not done | Show documented justifications alongside pay gap data |
| Band assignment history | ✗ Not done | When did each employee's band last change, and why? |
| Pay gap narrative export | ✗ Not done | HR-facing summary report suitable for regulatory submission |
| Salary band coverage enforcement | ✗ Not done | Warn when adding/editing a role with no band defined |
| Location multipliers | ✓ Done | Already in `paybands.html` |

This module should be designed with clean boundaries from the org-data module, as it is the most likely candidate for extraction into a dedicated microservice with its own security controls.

---

## M6 — AI Assistant (role-scoped, data-aware) ⚠ Partially Complete
The AI assistant sits on top of the existing permission-filtered API. It receives a scoped view of data identical to what the logged-in user can see — it never bypasses the role layer or accesses data the user could not access directly.

**M6 Progress:**
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `ai.html` — UI shell | ✓ Done | Chat interface wired up |
| `routes/v1/ai.js` — backend route | ✓ Done | Identity from JWT, context includes manager names, role occupant map |
| Role-scoped data context | ✓ Done | Passes permission-filtered org snapshot to AI |
| AI action cards + apply flow | ✓ Done | Apply button gated on write rights; server enforces independently |
| Audit log for AI queries | ✓ Done | `operation: "AI_QUERY"`, `source: "ai"` |
| Conversational context / history | ✗ Not done | Currently stateless per message |
| Proactive org insights | ✗ Not done | AI surfacing anomalies without being asked |
| Natural-language report queries | ✗ Not done | "Show me headcount by dept" → runs report |

Do not build the AI layer to call the database directly. It must go through the same API and permission checks as any other client.

---

## M7 — HR Processes & Workflows
Structured HR activities: onboarding checklists, role change requests, promotion workflows, performance cycles. Managers initiate; HR approves. Notifications and approval chains.

---

## M8 — Export & External Integrations
PDF, CSV, Excel, XML, and JSON exports. Public API for third-party system integrations. Webhooks for events (role changes, new hires, salary changes). Import pipelines (the CSV import in M1 is a precursor to this).

**Messaging platform bots (Slack / Microsoft Teams)** — A thin relay bot that receives messages in Slack or Teams, resolves the sender to a Teampura person (via email match), and calls the AI assistant API on their behalf. Permissions and data scoping are enforced identically to the web UI — the bot is a client of the existing API, not a bypass. Slack is the recommended first target; Teams follows the same pattern using Azure Bot Service (natural fit given the existing Azure deployment). Write-back (data change suggestions via interactive buttons / Adaptive Cards) is a natural extension of the web UI's confirm-before-apply flow.

---

## M9 — Onboarding & Guided UX
Step-by-step onboarding flows per user role. Contextual tooltips and walkthroughs to reduce the learning curve when rolling out to a new customer organisation.

---

## M10 — Infrastructure Hardening
Advanced database and security features deferred from earlier milestones, to be tackled once the product has real customers and the complexity is justified:

- **CDC Triggers** — PostgreSQL `BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` triggers on all data tables writing to `audit_log` in the same transaction, so the audit trail is guaranteed regardless of what writes to the DB (admin tools, migration scripts, etc.)
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** — PostgreSQL RLS policies enforcing tenant isolation at the database level, so Org A can never see Org B's data even if application code has a bug. Enables the shared multi-tenant deployment tier.
- **Schema-per-tenant** — Full schema isolation for dedicated-DB and enterprise tiers.

---

## M11 — Mobile (separate codebase)
A mobile application is out of scope for this codebase. It will be a separate app that consumes the versioned API from M2/M8. No decisions in this codebase should be made to accommodate mobile — keep the web app desktop-first.

---

## Standing Architectural Rules

These apply across all milestones and must not be violated:

1. **`orgId` on every entity** — all data records carry an `orgId` at all times, even in M1 where it is always `"default"`.
2. **Server-side enforcement** — access rules, data visibility, and business logic are enforced on the server. UI hiding is cosmetic only and never a substitute for server-side checks.
3. **Sensitive data is opt-in** — salary, personal identifiers, and other sensitive fields are never returned by the API unless the requesting user's role explicitly permits it.
4. **Versioned API** — all routes are under `/api/v1/`. Breaking changes require a new version, never modification of an existing route.
5. **Audit log** — all data changes are logged with field-level granularity (entity, field, old value, new value, actor, timestamp, IP, user agent, change reason, correlation ID). In M1 stored in `changelog.json`; in M2+ in the PostgreSQL `audit_log` table. This log is strictly append-only — no entry may ever be modified or deleted.
6. **Encryption** — sensitive fields are encrypted at rest with tenant-isolated keys. Keys are never embedded in application code.
7. **No data in URLs** — sensitive data must never appear in URLs, query strings, or browser history.
8. **Module boundaries** — each module (auth, org-data, compensation, workflows, AI, export) owns its own routes, data access, and logic. Cross-module calls go through defined interfaces only.
9. **Import/export by design** — the data model should always assume that data may need to be imported from or exported to external systems. Avoid internal-only IDs or formats that cannot be mapped to a standard representation.
10. **Mobile is a separate app** — do not add complexity to this codebase for mobile compatibility. The API is the mobile integration point.
