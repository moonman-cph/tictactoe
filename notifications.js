      title:  'Operator Console & Changelog fixes (0.9.31)',
      body:   'Several fixes to the Operator Console and Changelog, including a multi-org changelog bug and org name in the navigation.',
      detail: 'This release bundles several fixes made since 0.9.30: (1) Changelog entries were hardcoded to the default organisation — changes made by any other org were invisible to them and leaked into the default org\'s log. Fixed. (2) Last Login dates were not showing in the Operator Console due to a camelCase field name mismatch. Fixed. (3) Last login IP address is now recorded and shown next to Last Login in the Operator Console — the IPv4-mapped IPv6 prefix (::ffff:) is stripped so addresses display cleanly. (4) Organisation name now appears below the Teampura logo in the left navigation after login. (5) The stale "single-user mode" banner has been removed from the Changelog page.',

      body:   'Changelog now filters by organisation, shows employee IDs on person changes, and has consistent column alignment.',
      detail: 'Three improvements to the Audit Log: (1) Changelog entries are now filtered to only show the current organisation — both in database and file-storage mode. (2) Person-related changes now show the employee ID below the person\'s name, making it easier to identify exactly who was affected. (3) Column widths are now fixed across all save-event groups, so Op / Type / Entity / Field / Old / New always align consistently.',

      body:   'Users now load automatically on the Users tab, and the organisation column now shows correctly.',
      detail: 'Two bugs fixed in the Operator Console Users tab: (1) The user list was intentionally deferred to first search, but now loads automatically when you switch to the tab. (2) The Organisation column was always blank due to a camelCase/snake_case mismatch — the API returns orgName directly, which is now used instead of a client-side lookup.',

      body:   'Fixed Chrome autofilling the Operator Console search fields with saved credentials.',
      detail: 'Chrome was ignoring autocomplete hints and autofilling the org and user search fields with the logged-in email address. Fixed using the readonly-on-load technique — fields start as readonly (which Chrome never autofills) and become editable on first focus.',

      detail: 'Chrome was ignoring autocomplete="off" on the search inputs in the Operator Console and autofilling them with the logged-in user\'s email address (treating them as credential fields due to nearby email/password inputs in modals).

      body:   'Fixed a bug where the organisation list disappeared on any click due to browser autofill.',
      detail: 'Chrome was autofilling the organisation search input with the logged-in user\'s email address on first interaction, causing the search filter to activate and show "No organisations found". The fix detects browser autofill (which fires input events with no inputType) and clears the field instead of applying the filter. Also fixed the missing flex layout on the Operator Console page header.',

      detail: 'A new organisations table stores org id, name, slug, plan tier, status, and trial expiry. Migration v5 seeds the default org on first boot. The force_logout_at column was added to the users table, enabling server-side session invalidation. These are foundation changes for the M4 operator console and future multi-tenant management.',

      detail: 'A background scheduler runs on the server every 60 seconds. When you freeze a planned change with "Freeze as planned change", a scheduled job is registered in the database. The change will now fire at the exact time — whether or not anyone is logged in. The scheduler also captures a daily metrics snapshot (headcount, salary totals, vacancies, gender split, level distribution) which will power trend reports in a future release. Every automated change is recorded in the audit log with source "scheduled_job" so the trail is fully attributable. Snapshots and planned change state are now also properly persisted to the database (previously lost on server restart).',

It covers all person fields in the database: preferred name, email, phone, address, nationality, hire date, employment type, contract type, probation end, FTE, working hours, job family, country, city, legal entity, cost centre, emergency contact name and phone — in addition to the original core fields. Fields are grouped into Person, Employment, Location, Contact, Role, and Hierarchy sections. Auto-hint matching and value mapping (↔ Map values) work for all enum fields. The Hierarchy group (manager name, manager ID, dotted-line manager ID) now has a callout explaining these resolve relationships during import rather than being stored directly.',

      detail: 'The dashboard previously used a 4-column grid with no width cap, causing cards to look stretched on wide monitors. It now uses 6 columns: KPI cards and donut charts share the top row, chart cards sit 3-per-row beneath, and the Org Health summary takes a clean full-width row at the bottom. Responsive breakpoints collapse the layout to 4 columns at ≤1100px, 2 columns at ≤720px, and 1 column on mobile.',

      detail: 'Previously AI-applied changes (department/role/person operations) were stored in the changelog with source "ui", making them indistinguishable from manual edits. They are now stored with source "ai".

      detail: 'The app previously shipped with 120 hardcoded employees, 117 roles, and 10 departments baked into the JavaScript. These would silently re-appear after clearing data due to various edge cases in the initialization flow. All seed data has been removed. The org chart now starts completely empty — use Import CSV (org chart page, left nav) with fixtures/default-seed-120.csv if you want to restore the sample dataset.

      body:   'Fixed regression: Clear Data was triggering a full default re-seed on the Org Chart instead of staying empty.',
      detail: 'The 0.9.11 fix for Reset Data introduced a regression: the "initialized" check used empty arrays as the condition, which matched both Reset Data (bare {}) and Clear Data (explicit empty arrays). Now only a bare {} reset clears the initialized flag — explicit empty-array saves (Clear Employees, Clear Structure, Clear Data) keep the flag set so the Org Chart correctly stays empty.',

      body:   'Reset Data and the AI roleAssignment fix — Reset Data now triggers a full re-seed on the Org Chart instead of leaving it empty.',
      detail: 'Two bug fixes: (1) Reset Data was broken — after posting empty data, the server kept an internal "_initialized" flag set, so the Org Chart saw an empty-but-initialized state and never re-seeded. Now, posting truly empty data clears that flag so the Org Chart seeds fresh default data on the next load. (2) Persons created by the AI now include the correct percentage (100%) and orgId on their role assignments, matching the expected shape across the app.',

      body:   'Departments and roles created by the AI now use numeric IDs, fixing "Cannot connect to server" on the Org Chart after AI changes.',
      detail: 'The root cause of the Org Chart crash after AI creates roles or departments: the org chart uses numeric IDs throughout (nextRoleId, Math.max over all role IDs, etc.). When the AI created entities with UUID string IDs, Math.max(...ids) returned NaN, breaking ID generation and rendering in subtle ways. AI-created entities now use nextNumericId() — the same sequential logic the org chart uses — so they integrate seamlessly. Also fixed a String() conversion that was stripping the native type from department IDs when resolving name→ID fallbacks.',

      detail: 'Previously the destructive data actions (Clear Employees, Clear Structure, Clear Data, Reset Data) were only shown in the nav when you were on the Org Chart page — and if the Org Chart itself failed to load, there was no way to recover. These items now appear in the left nav on every page for users with manage_settings permission. Import CSV remains Org Chart only.',

      body:   'Applying multiple AI-suggested changes in quick succession no longer overwrites earlier ones, and department name/ID mismatches no longer crash the org chart.',
      detail: 'Two bugs fixed in the AI action card flow. First, clicking Apply on several cards quickly could cause a race where each card fetched the same pre-change state and the last write won, losing earlier changes. Applies are now serialised — each waits for the previous to finish. Second, the AI sometimes passed a department name (e.g. "Sales") where a department ID was expected; the org chart then failed to find the department and threw inside init(), showing "Cannot connect to server". Apply logic now resolves names to IDs automatically as a fallback. Also fixed a missing id field on role assignments created via create_person.',

      detail: 'The AI assistant previously could only suggest field-level edits (e.g. change a salary or job title). It can now propose structural changes: creating a new department or role, moving a role to a different department or manager, and deleting empty departments, roles, or people. As before, every proposal appears as a confirm card — nothing changes until you click Apply.

      detail: 'The database was returning an empty response when all data was cleared, which the client treated as "fresh install — seed with 120 employees".
