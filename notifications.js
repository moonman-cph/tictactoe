      body:   'The AI assistant now uses your active login session — no more "You are" selector. Apply access is gated on your actual permission rights.',
      detail: 'The AI assistant page no longer shows a person selector. Your identity is taken directly from your authenticated session, so previewing as any person via Switch User automatically gives the AI the right context. The "Apply change" button on AI suggestions is now gated on edit rights from the Permissions page (edit_org_chart, edit_directory, edit_salaries) rather than a hard-coded role list. The M1 notice on the Permissions page has also been removed.',

      title:  'Fix data scoping for user preview (0.9.2)',
      body:   'Previewing as a person now correctly shows the data that person is entitled to see — salaries, pay bands, and org chart editing all reflect their actual permission groups.',
      detail: 'When switching to view as a person via the Switch User modal, data was being filtered using the JWT base role (always "employee") rather than the person\'s actual effective rights from their permission groups. This caused the dashboard to show only one person, pay bands to appear empty, and the org chart to show a connection error. All three issues are now fixed by computing effective rights server-side before scoping data.',

      body:   'Switch user now previews any person using their org chart job title — rights are determined entirely by the permissions page rules, with no manual role selection.',
      detail: 'The Switch User modal no longer shows a role dropdown. Every person in the org chart can now be previewed simply by clicking "Log in as" — their effective rights come from the assignment policies and permission groups configured on the Permissions page, exactly as they would in production. The impersonation banner now shows the person\'s real name instead of a synthesised email address.',

      detail: 'The Switch User modal now lists every person in the organisation. People with an existing user account show their role and use the normal login-as flow. People without an account show a role selector (Employee / Manager / HR Admin / Org Admin) — selecting a role and clicking Log in as creates a temporary impersonation session scoped to that person and role, with no credentials stored.

Users with <em>view_pay_bands</em> but not <em>edit_pay_bands</em> see all band and multiplier data in read-only mode: inputs are non-editable, Save/Delete/reorder buttons are hidden, the Add Band and Add Country rows are hidden, and the location multiplier toggle is disabled.',

Rights are derived from the Permissions page (permission groups, assignment policies, and individual overrides) and fall back to sensible role defaults when no policies are configured.\n\nManagers can view the org chart but cannot drag, drop, or edit roles. Employees see a read-only org chart with no salary figures. HR admins and org admins retain full access.\n\nSalary visibility and view-only mode in the org chart settings panel are automatically locked for roles that do not have the corresponding right — the toggles are disabled and display a tooltip indicating they are permission-controlled.\n\nThese rights are returned from GET /api/v1/auth/me on every page load, so changes made in the Permissions page take effect the next time a user loads a page.',

The encryption key is held separately in Azure App Service settings, not in the database or codebase.
